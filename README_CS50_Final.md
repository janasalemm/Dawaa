# Dawaa – Smart Medication Scheduler Web App

**Dawaa** is an Arabic-language web application designed to help individuals keep track of their daily medication schedule. The app enables users to add medicines, specify how many times per day to take them, and the specific times for each dose. It is especially helpful for elderly people, individuals with chronic conditions, and anyone who needs structured reminders for medications.

## Project Description

### The Problem:
Many people, especially those with chronic illnesses or multiple prescriptions, struggle to remember when and how often they should take their medications. A missed dose or taking the wrong medication at the wrong time can have serious health consequences.

### The Solution:
**Dawaa** offers a simple and intuitive interface where users can record their medications and organize them into a clear daily schedule. The app also presents the data in a structured table for quick access and review.

## Key Features

- Clean and responsive Arabic user interface.
- Add a new medication including:
  - Name of the medication.
  - Number of times it should be taken daily.
  - Specific timing for each dose (e.g., 8 AM, 2 PM, 9 PM).
- View all added medications in a formatted HTML table.
- Edit and future-delete capabilities can be added.
- Custom styling using CSS to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Main programming language
- **Flask** – Web framework used for routing and rendering templates
- **SQLite** – Lightweight relational database used to store medicine records
- **HTML + Jinja2** – Templates for rendering the web pages
- **CSS** – Custom styling for UI appearance

---

## How It Works

1. The user runs the Flask app and accesses the web interface.
2. On the home page, the user can view all current medications.
3. The "Add" page allows the user to enter the name, frequency, and timing of each medication.
4. All entries are saved into a SQLite database.
5. The user sees their medications organized in a table with details for easy tracking.

## Future Improvements

- Add user accounts and login system.
- Enable edit and delete functions for medication entries.
- Integrate SMS/email reminders at medication times.
- Mobile-friendly UI for easier access from smartphones and tablets.
- Allow multiple user profiles for family medication management.

## How to Run Locally

1. Install Flask if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. Visit:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

4. To access the app from another device (e.g., iPad), run:
   ```
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0
   ```
   Then go to:
   ```
   http://<your-computer-IP>:5000
   ```

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me apply key concepts from CS50 including web development, routing, database interaction, and user-centered design. It also allowed me to build something practical that can benefit real users with everyday health needs. I hope to expand and improve Dawaa with more advanced features in the future.
